# Artificial Bee Colony for TSP Optimization

## Description
This project implements an **Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm** to find the optimal route for the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**. The program evaluates the fitness of different routes and improves solutions iteratively using **employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees**.

## Installation
To run the code, install the following Python packages:
```bash
